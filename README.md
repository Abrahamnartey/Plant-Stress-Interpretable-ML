# Plant Stress Interpretable Machine Learning

## Problem
Predict plant stress conditions from transcriptomic data using interpretable machine learning models.

## Data
Publicly available gene expression data from GEO:
- GSE5686 (Arabidopsis stress responses)

## Methods
- Logistic Regression (L1 regularization)
- Random Forest
- SHAP for model interpretability

## Results
Interpretable models achieve competitive classification performance and identify biologically relevant stress-associated genes.

## Reproducibility
Create the analysis environment using:

## Repository Structure
- data/: raw and processed data references
- notebooks/: exploratory and modeling notebooks
- src/: reusable Python scripts
- results/: figures and tables
- paper/: manuscript files
